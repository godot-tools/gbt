BehaviorTrees plugin for the Godot engine.

This project is _heavily_ inspired by [godot-behavior-tree-plugin](https://github.com/godot-addons/godot-behavior-tree-plugin) by [brandonlamb](https://github.com/brandonlamb).

I have taken his code base and stripped it down and cleaned it up. Henceforth, I will be improving the usability of the plugin and ehancing the workflow to increase development velocity.
